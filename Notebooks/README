1. 		SingleQuery_NoPBC	Consists of benchmarks associated with single query
					for cell-list, different KDtree, Octree (not yet). 
					It also contains the variation ofexecution time 
					with respect to variation in particles per cell 
					for the cell-list data structure for single queries.

2. 		Octree			Comparison of adhoc octree C++ code (Behley 2015),
					with KDtree (PBC and Non PBC structure).

3. 		CellGrid_Optimization	Optimization of cellgrid module to evaluate optimized
					particles per cell.

4. 		BM_Selection_SphProtein	Selection around spherical protein centred around the 
					midpoint of the box. Two different groups of particles
					are treated as solvent and protein particles.

5. 		BM_Selection_Slab	Two slabs of particles and selection of group of particles 
					around each other within a cutoff distance

6. 		BM_PairContact		Selection of all particles within a cutoff distance
					and comparison between KDTree, Celllist, Brute Force
